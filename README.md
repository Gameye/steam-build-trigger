# Steam distribution updater
Update steam distributions when a new version is released by steam

## Automated tests
Never commit something that breaks the build! You can
easily prevent this by linking the `test.sh` script as a git `pre-commit` hook!

like this:
```bash
ln test.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
